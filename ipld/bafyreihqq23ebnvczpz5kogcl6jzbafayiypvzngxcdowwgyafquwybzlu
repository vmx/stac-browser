It consists of three identical Synthetic Aperture Radar (C-Band) Earth observation satellites approximatively half the size of its predecessors. The three-satellite configuration will provide daily revisits (on average) of Canada's vast territory and maritime approaches, including the Arctic up to 4 times a day, as well as daily access to any point of 90% of the world's surface.lstac_versione0.7.0
